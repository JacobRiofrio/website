        <h1>INTEREST</h1>
        <p>Throughout my whole life, I have always had in interest in video games and so I thought I would like computer science.</p>
        <p>Turns out, it does not suit me, and I have found interest in things like sociology and psychology.</p>
        <p>I also like playing sports and enjoy time outside.</p>
