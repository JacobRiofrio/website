        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>In elementary school, I was a bit adventurous and loved to play around.</p>
        <p>In middle school, I struggled some in school but eventually had lots of fun.</p>
        <p>Now that I am in high school, I have found myself and look forward to advancing my education.</p>
