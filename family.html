        <h1>FAMILY</h1>
        <p>I love my family and everyone that's in it. They are the people that have shaped who I am. My mom, who taught me how the world works.
            My dad, who taught me how to have fun and enjoy life. My step dad, who stepped in later in life but taught me valuable lessons about
            being responsible. And finally, my little sister who I now teach my beliefs to.
