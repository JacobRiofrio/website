        <h1>FAMILY</h1>
        <p>I love my family and everyone that's in it. They are the people that have shaped who I am.</p>
            <p>My mom, who taught me how the world works.</p>
            <p>My dad, who taught me how to have fun and enjoy life.</p>
            <p>My step dad, who stepped in later in life but taught me valuable lessons about being responsible.</p>
            <p>And finally, my little sister who I now teach my beliefs to.</p>
